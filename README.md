# telco-customer-churn-analysis
# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This project analyzes customer churn behavior in a telecommunications company using Excel, Python, and Power BI. The objective was to identify the key drivers of customer attrition and provide actionable business recommendations to improve retention.Through data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and dashboard development, the analysis revealed that customers on month-to-month contracts, those with higher monthly charges, and customers with shorter tenure exhibit significantly higher churn rates. Additionally, certain service types and payment methods were associated with increased churn risk.A comprehensive Power BI dashboard was developed to visualize churn patterns and customer segments, enabling stakeholders to monitor high-risk groups effectively. Based on the findings, strategic recommendations such as promoting long-term contracts, enhancing early-stage customer engagement, and implementing targeted retention campaigns were proposed.This project demonstrates strong analytical, visualization, and business interpretation skills by transforming raw data into meaningful insights that support data-driven decision-making.
# BUSINESS PROBLEM
The telecom company is experiencing a significant rate of customer churn, which directly impacts revenue, profitability, and long-term business sustainability. Customer acquisition costs in the telecommunications industry are typically high due to marketing, promotions, and onboarding expenses. As a result, losing existing customers not only reduces recurring revenue but also increases the overall cost of growth.Churn is often influenced by multiple factors such as pricing, contract type, service quality, customer tenure, billing methods, and competition. Without a clear understanding of why customers leave, the company risks continuing revenue leakage and ineffective retention strategies.The primary objective of this analysis is to identify the key drivers of customer churn using historical customer data. By examining demographic characteristics, service subscriptions, billing information, and contract details, this project aims to:
- Determine which customer segments are most likely to churn
- Identify behavioral and service-related patterns associated with churn
- Quantify the impact of different factors on customer attrition
- Provide actionable, data-driven recommendations to reduce churn
The ultimate goal is to support strategic decision-making by enabling the company to implement targeted retention initiatives, improve customer satisfaction, and enhance overall customer lifetime value
